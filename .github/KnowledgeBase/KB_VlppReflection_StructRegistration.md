# Struct Registration

## Registration patterns for structure types with field access capabilities.

VlppReflection provides specific macros for registering structure types, enabling runtime access to struct fields through the reflection system. This allows structures to be used in dynamic programming scenarios while maintaining their value-type semantics.

## Basic Struct Registration

### Registration Pattern
- Use `BEGIN_STRUCT_MEMBER` and `END_STRUCT_MEMBER` for struct registration
- Provides the foundation for making struct types accessible through reflection
- Enables dynamic field access and manipulation

```cpp
BEGIN_STRUCT_MEMBER(MyStruct)
    STRUCT_MEMBER(FirstField)
    STRUCT_MEMBER(SecondField)
END_STRUCT_MEMBER(MyStruct)
```

### Field Registration
- Use `STRUCT_MEMBER` to register each accessible field
- Each field registered becomes accessible through the reflection system
- Supports both reading and writing field values dynamically

## Registration Requirements

### Struct Definition
The struct must be properly defined and accessible:
- Must be a valid C++ struct type
- Fields to be registered must be public members
- Should follow value-type semantics

### Field Accessibility
- Only register fields that should be accessible through reflection
- Private and protected fields cannot be registered directly
- Consider data encapsulation principles when choosing which fields to expose

## Usage Example

Register a struct like this:
```cpp
BEGIN_STRUCT_MEMBER(MyStruct)
    STRUCT_MEMBER(FirstField)
    STRUCT_MEMBER(SecondField)
END_STRUCT_MEMBER(MyStruct)
```

This registration pattern enables:
- Dynamic field access by name
- Type-safe field value retrieval and assignment
- Integration with the broader reflection system
- Use in Workflow scripts and other dynamic contexts

## Extra Content

### Advanced Registration Scenarios

#### Complex Field Types
Struct fields can be of various types:
- Primitive types (int, double, bool, etc.)
- String types (WString, etc.)
- Other registered structs
- Enum types

#### Nested Structs
When registering structs that contain other struct types:
1. Register the nested struct types first
2. Then register the containing struct
3. The reflection system will automatically handle the relationships

#### Read-Only Fields
While `STRUCT_MEMBER` typically requires both reading and writing:
- Some fields may be conceptually read-only
- Consider the design implications of exposing mutable access
- Document field mutability expectations clearly

### Best Practices

1. **Selective Registration**: Only register fields that need dynamic access
2. **Type Consistency**: Ensure all field types are also properly registered
3. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and constraints of registered fields
4. **Testing**: Verify registration works correctly with dynamic access patterns

### Performance Considerations

- Struct registration has minimal overhead at registration time
- Dynamic field access is slightly slower than direct access
- Consider performance implications for frequently accessed fields
- Batch operations when possible for better performance

### Integration with Other Systems

Registered structs can be used with:
- Workflow script language
- GacUI data binding
- Serialization systems
- Dynamic configuration systems
