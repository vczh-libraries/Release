# Release
Release folder of all projects.

**Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/LICENSE.md) first.**

**Read [GacUI website](http://vczh-libraries.github.io/) or [the mirror website](http://gaclib.net) for more information.**

Download code from [public releases](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/releases) to get the latest stable release. Code from this repo is also usable but I don't make any promise. I will only make a new release when I think the code is ready to update.

## Visual Studio Extension

Copy [Vlpp.natvis](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Import/vlpp.natvis) to Visual Studio's visualizers folder.

For example, VS2022's default visualizers folder will be **C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers**.

## Creating a GacUI app using CMake

Third party project for GacUI 1.0: https://github.com/mangosroom/GacUI-CMake-support

This project is not maintained by members in **vczh-libraries** organization.
In the future there could be some mismatch in the file list,
which could be easily fixed.

## Building using vcpkg

You can build and install vlpp using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

  - git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
  - cd vcpkg
  - ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat for Windows
  - ./vcpkg integrate install
  - ./vcpkg install vlpp

Source files in the "Import" folder are grouped by different features defined in [CMakeLists.txt](./Import/CMakeLists.txt).

The vlpp port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
